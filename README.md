# Weather-at-a-drop

## Description

This website application was created with the purpose of a user getting a current forecast for a city they searched and also a 5-day forecast underneath it with the searched cities also being displayed from local storage. When the User first enters the page, they are presented with a header of the website name and a search bar to look up a city. When the User types in the city name to the search bar then clicks search, then a box displaying the current weather of the city name with an icon representing the weather and information regarding the temperature, wind speed, and humidity percentage is shown. Underneath that box is the five day forecast with 5 different card elements representing each day with the same info types according to that day being displayed in the cards. Under the search bar is an element for the previous searched cities, that when clicked will bring up the search for the specific city.
